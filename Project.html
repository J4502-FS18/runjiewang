<p>Although not intense as animal cruelty incidents, the surplus of stray and abandoned animals is a chronic burden on communities like Columbia, Missouri.</P>

<p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) estimates that around 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year, and 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized.</P>

<p>Diann Stelzer, vice president of Boone County Animal Care (BCAC), said that the presence of three colleges surrounding downtown makes this nationwide matter unique in Columbia.</P>

<p>She said graduates, especially international students, as well as other residents moving to a new place were highly likely to surrender their beloved pets. Some went to animal rescue centers, while some were abandoned.</P>


<p>“Students don’t think about it,” Stelzer said. “Animals living indoor can’t survive on the streets when they got released.</P>

<p>She witnessed the influx of homeless cats or dogs in May and December every year when some graduates left town and relinquished their pets.</P>

<p>“Some foreign students visited us looking for adoptive cats, and I asked them, ‘So what are you going to do with kitties after graduation,’ and then they said, ‘We can take them back home with us,’” she added.</P>

<p>“You’ve got to acquire a bunch of documents to enter a country with an animal. It’s not that easy,” Stelzer said.</P>

<p>Dawei Li, owner of a 3-year-old cat, sought a new adopter for a month on social media and finally found one.</P>

<p>“I adopted my kitten from the Central Missouri Humane Society, and I didn’t really want to send him back to them when I left,” he said.</P>

<p>Li’s cat is lucky that it doesn’t have to fend for itself. But many homeless cats end up in the local humane society and die, Stelzer said.</P>

<p>On top of that, companion animals are much more fecund than human beings.</P>

<p>“Moms have kittens and kittens have their babies within a year, and it just multiplies,” kitten foster Janeene Johnston said.</P>

<p>Eric Stann, spokesman of Columbia/Boone Public Health and Human Services, said Columbia’s large feral cat population overwhelms local animal adoption facilities.</P>

<p>Domestic cats become stray cats when they are abandoned and live outdoors. They finally turn into feral cats as their contact with humans dwindles.</P>

<p>BCAC is one of the facilities that doesn’t pass over the supervision of feral cats. But as an entirely foster-based animal welfare, BCAC grapples with the shortages from different aspects.</P>

<p>“Funds can always be a problem,” Stelzer continued. “We are in need of donations for spay and neuter surgeries and routine vaccinations.”</P>

<p>Additionally, the conglomeration of kittens and cats has built up over the past three months.</P>

<p>“Now, we have about 75 kittens in volunteers’ homes, which is way beyond our capacity,” Stelzer said. “But we still got people calling us and reporting the stray kittens and moms.”</P>

<p>Many other organizations taking care of companion animals tackle similar situations.</P>

<p>“We’re consistently short-handed on volunteer foster homes where we house our dogs,” said Melody Whitworth, the executive director of Unchained Melodies Dog Rescue.</P>

<p>That’s the reason why many shelters encourage animal adoption over buying, because it not only costs less but also helps create more space for rescue organizations and shelters, thereby reducing overpopulation.</P>

<p>“There is a sad part that there will always be kittens,” Stelzer said. “But if we spay or neuter adult cats, the number of the homeless will be decreased.</P>

<p>Spay and neuter are proved to be effective and straightforward ways to combat overpopulation.</P>

<p>In 2013, No Kill Columbia launched a new spay/neuter clinic, the Spay and Neuter Project, providing affordable and attainable service to restrain the number of teeming, homeless litters.</P>

<p>The Spay and Neuter Project is recognized by the nationally renowned nonprofit Humane Alliance and its National Spay/Neuter Response Team (NSNRT), according to a press release.</P>

<p>Serving more than 14 Mid-Missouri counties, it is the fourth NSNRT clinic in the state of Missouri and is able to perform over 8,000 surgeries annually.</P>


<p>"Until now, we have implemented approximately 7,000 surgeries, including around 800 TNRs,” said Carissa Luttrell, a registered veterinary technician with the Spay and Neuter Project.</P>

<p>TNR, the acronym for Trap-Neuter-Return, is the way of humanely trapping feral cats, having them spayed and neutered at veterinary facilities and transporting them back to the place where they are located.</P>

<p>No Kill Columbia President Liz Burks said, “With thousands of dogs and cats losing their lives every year in Missouri shelters, this service is an essential and proactive solution to reducing intake at area shelters.”</P>

<p>“I can’t say enough about everything they do,” Johnston said. “Pet owners should think about consequences of unrestricted reproduction of animals.”</P>

<p>At the city level, the Columbia Animal Control Department partners the Central Missouri Humane Society to cater to pet owners who can’t afford the surgeries with free, limited spay/neuter vouchers.</P>

<p>In addition, the department enforces ordinances, investigates animal cruelty and educates the public.</P>

<p>Other routines available for responsible pet owners include licensing, disciplining and sheltering, Stann suggested.</P>
